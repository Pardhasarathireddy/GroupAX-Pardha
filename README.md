> *An autonomous Agentic AI system that audits codebases, detects potential security or quality issues, and generates explainable insights using LLMs, RAG, and LangChain Agents.*

---

### 🚀 Short Summary
A self-governing **AI DevOps Assistant** that acts as a code reviewer, security auditor, and documentation analyst — powered by **Agentic AI**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **LangChain Agents**.  
It understands your codebase, finds issues, and explains them intelligently — like an AI teammate for developers.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Modern software teams maintain vast repositories with hundreds of files, dependencies, and build configurations.  
Ensuring **code quality, security, and documentation consistency** has become a major DevOps challenge — often requiring time-consuming manual code reviews and specialized analysis tools.

Existing static analyzers and CI pipelines:
- ❌ Fail to reason about *context* or code intent  
- ❌ Lack *autonomy* in correlating issues across modules  
- ❌ Don’t *explain* their findings in developer-friendly language  

**Problem:** There is a critical need for an **autonomous AI-powered DevOps assistant** that continuously audits repositories, identifies anomalies, and recommends improvements — reducing manual workload and accelerating software quality assurance.

## 🤖 Solution Description

**AI Developer Ops Agent** is an **Agentic AI system** designed to autonomously analyze software repositories, detect risks, and produce explainable recommendations.

### 🧠 Core Concept
> “Transform any GitHub repo into a self-auditing, self-reporting AI code reviewer.”

The agent performs:
- **Code scanning** → retrieves relevant files via embeddings  
- **Tool-based reasoning** → uses specialized analysis tools  
- **LLM synthesis** → summarizes issues and suggests fixes  

### 🔍 Key Capabilities
- Scans code, dependencies, and configurations  
- Detects TODOs, code smells, security keywords  
- Flags risky or outdated dependencies  
- Generates structured JSON reports with confidence scores  
- Provides “explainable AI” outputs citing the source lines

🧩 Components
Layer	Description
Ingestion Layer	Ingests local or GitHub repositories (code, docs, configs).
RAG Layer	Chunks & embeds repo files using OpenAI embeddings, stores in ChromaDB.
Agentic Reasoning Layer	LangChain-based DevOps Agent orchestrates tool calls & LLM reasoning.
Tools	CODE_SEARCH, STATIC_ANALYZER, DEP_CHECK tools for repo analysis.
Output Layer	JSON + Markdown reports summarizing findings and suggested fixes.

🧰 Tech Stack
Language: Python

Frameworks: LangChain, FastAPI

Database: ChromaDB (Vector Store)

LLM Models: OpenAI GPT-4o / Local LLMs

Embeddings: text-embedding-3-small or SentenceTransformers

Utilities: GitPython, PyGithub, dotenv, pytest

⚙️ Features
✅ Autonomous multi-agent reasoning
✅ RAG-based context retrieval
✅ Static & dependency analysis tools
✅ Guardrails for safety & reliability
✅ FastAPI endpoint (/ask) for interactive queries
✅ JSON-based explainable reports
✅ Reproducible notebooks & evaluation scripts

🧩 Guardrails & Evaluation
Guardrails Implemented
Confidence Guardrail — If retrieval similarity < 0.7 → output INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE.

Safety Guardrail — Agent only reads files; never modifies or executes code.

Explainability Guardrail — Each issue flagged includes source file and line context.

Evaluation Metrics
Metric	Description
Precision	Ratio of correctly identified issues
Recall	Coverage of known issues
Latency	Time per analysis request
Hallucination Rate	% of false positives
Explainability	% of outputs with valid source citations
